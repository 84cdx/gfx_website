            <p>
                From a young age, I’ve been passionate about graphic design, starting with YouTube thumbnails and social
                media banners. What began as a hobby has grown into a versatile skill set that spans graphic design,
                mixed media design, branding, motion design, UI/UX, and web design. Over the years, I’ve had the
                privilege of working with a wide range of companies, musicians, and internet personalities, helping them
                bring their creative visions to life.
                <br><br>
                I’ve always had a love for art, and I find it incredibly exciting to collaborate with new clients across
                different industries to find innovative design solutions. Whether it’s creating a fresh brand identity
                or enhancing user experience through thoughtful design, I’m passionate about turning ideas into
                impactful visuals.
