# Graphic Design Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website, specifically developed to showcase completed graphic design projects and provide a way to get in touch. This website offers a user-friendly, interactive interface to professionally present my work.

## **Project Overview**

The website consists of several pages built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

   - The **Projects Page** features images of my work, which can be enlarged in a lightbox view upon clicking.

### 2. **Masonry Layout for Projects**:
   - A dynamic grid layout is created using Masonry.js, which automatically adapts to the screen size.

### 3. **Scroll-to-Top Button**:
